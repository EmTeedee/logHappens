Bug happens ðŸ’© Every developer knows that. The bad thing is that if you want to see what happened, more often than not you have to crawl between hundred lines log files, written in a format which is all but human friendly.


##### That's why LogHappens exists!

LogHappens aims to fix exactly this. It is a simple tool, it will not prevent you from writing bugs, but it will notify you immediately when something has been logged by your web server or your favorite framework.


##### Does it handle different log formats?

Of course it does. Every software has its own bugs, and every software have its own way of logging things too. This is why I have tried to make it as simple as possible to let you create your own routine for reading log files. No fancy regex strings: if you just want to read the file, you can group log entries by date/time and print the rest of the file. If you are feeling adventurous, you can possibly do whatever you want: highlight words, create tags, split errors... the only limit is your fantasy.


##### How do I add a log file to be tracked?

LogHappens 2.x made it much simpler to add tracking for a new file. Just add a new record in your config.json file, and set the values according to your preferences. Something like this

    "apache": {
        "icon": "logos:apache",
        "color": "#104B73",
        "title": "Apache error",
        "file": "/var/log/apache2/error.log",
        "parser": "apache24"
    }

##### Can I share a new parser file?

Of course! As you see, I have placed apache24, CakePHP 3.x and CodeIgniter log files in the `parsers` folder. If you have created your own routine, please send it to me, I will be more than happy to add it to the other parsers!


##### What does it look like?

#### Troubleshooting

By default, apache log files are not readable by apache itself. Which is a good thing, at least on a production server. If you are on a development machine though you might want to give those files the correct permissions in order to be usable with LogHappens.
Here's how you do it:

* Edit /etc/logrotate.d/apache2, find the line saying create 640 root adm and replace with create 777 root adm.
* Add 777 permissions to the apache logs directory: sudo chmod -R 777 /var/log/apache2/


#### LogHappens can't read my application's log files!
Just set that file's permissions to 777, so that LogHappens can both read and write (truncate) that file.


#### Can I track a remote file (I.E. through a URL)?
If you are not worried for the security issues of having an error log publicly reachable, then yes. Just set the URL in the configuration path.

    'myExampleSite' => [
        "icon" => "wpf-online",
        "color" => "#104B73",
        "title" => "My ExampleSite Errors",
        "file" => "https://example.com/logs/error.log",
        "parser" => "cakephp3"
    ],
